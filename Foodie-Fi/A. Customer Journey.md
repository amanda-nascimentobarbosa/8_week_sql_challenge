### A. Customer Journey

**1. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!**
```SQL
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	s.plan_id,
	plan_name,
	start_date,
	price
FROM subscriptions s
LEFT JOIN plans p
	ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
```
**Result**
